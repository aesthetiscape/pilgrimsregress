This is a website I've built as a project to teach myself to write in html,
I've kind of left it hanging for a bit... but, here I am again!
The circle of time closes.

I think I might also use this as a virtual portfolio, project journal, etc.

We'll see.

  Hello again! I'm back, and I'm hoping to get things uploaded here, 
  and to start a hobby blog for theology.

  Ok, the gallery was working, but I've tried changing the name of the site
  and now it's not working. I've settled on Pilgrim's Regress as a title
  as a play on John Bunyan's work "Pilgrim's Progress." We are making our
  way back to the God Most High.
